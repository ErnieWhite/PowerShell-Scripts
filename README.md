# PowerShell-Scripts
* moveto - This script checks if a directory exists.  If it does not, the script creates it.
           Then, it navigates into the directory.
           If no directory name is provided as an argument, it displays usage instructions.
* prefix - Script to add a prefix to files in the current directory.
           If no prefix is provided, the script uses the current directory name as the prefix.
           The srcipt ensures that files do not recieve the prefix if they already have it.
* goto - This script makes the subdirectory specified on the command line that is under the base
         directory specified in the script itself.  Then it opens the directory in File Explorer.
